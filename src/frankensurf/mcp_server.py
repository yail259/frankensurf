    operational settings. Content does not certify live or sold state.
    allow_handoff=True lets a person clear a CAPTCHA, sign-in or 2FA wall in a
    visible browser when every automatic route fails; the call waits for them.
    lightning=True starts the read and two other tools at once and keeps the
    first complete page: faster first reads of slow or walled sites, at the cost
    of up to three requests to the site at once.
    allow_real_browser=True lets the owner's real Chrome (or Edge) try a page that
    keeps meeting walls, in a visible window with FrankenSurf's own profile. It
    never clicks; a wall that needs a person still fails.
    main_content=True returns the article without menus, footers or banners as
    text (receipt.main_content says how it was cut; full_text_chars is the size
    of the whole page's text). Use it for articles and news.
    items=True returns items (name, url, price, image) from a listing page with no
    saved module, found in the page's own data, plus result.auto_module: the
    drafted module, which site_modules put saves for every later read.
    allow_archive=True lets a walled page come from the Internet Archive's latest
    stored copy as the last resort; receipt.archived says when it was taken. Not
    live: don't use it for prices or stock.
    profile names a stored FrankenSurf login (see the profiles tool); the session
    itself never reaches the agent.
    try_harder_than takes the trace_id of an earlier read whose page wasn't what
    you needed: this read skips every tool that one tried and starts from the
    strongest remaining tool. receipt.if_not_right says what is left to try.
    expect_terms are words a search page's results should mention besides the
    URL's own query; results that mention none come back flagged
    completeness.off_query, with receipt.next_step, instead of escalating.
    card_images=True adds cards: each result link with its title and its own
    thumbnail URL, from the same page load.
    A saved site module matching the URL shapes the read by default (see the
    site_modules tool): the result gains items and receipt.module. module names
    one, "none" turns modules off, module_override runs an unsaved module once.
